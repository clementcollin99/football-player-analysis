# Football player analysis

Identification of player clusters in the [2022-2023 European Leagues Player Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-football-player-stats/data) dataset and intent to find the best possible combination of players using a genetic algorithm.

## Rough description of the dataset

It contains +2500 rows and 124 columns. Each entry corresponds to a player. Except a few columns describing the player (its name, age, club, etc.), the variables correspond to statistics (such as number of goals scored, number of assists made, etc.) for a set of soccer matches.

## Limitations

- "bad" players : a striker who doesn't score goals
