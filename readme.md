# Football player analysis

Identification of player clusters in the [2022-2023 European Leagues Player Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-football-player-stats/data) dataset and intent to find the best possible combination of players using a genetic algorithm.

## Rough description of the dataset

It contains +2500 rows and 124 columns. Each entry corresponds to a player. The first few columns are qualitative variables describing the player (its name, age, club, etc.) and the rest are "in-game" statistics (number of chances created, goals scored, assists, etc.).

## First task : players clustering

## Second task : find the best team possible

### Players value prediction

### Genetic algorithm

## Limitations

- "bad" players : a striker who doesn't score goals
